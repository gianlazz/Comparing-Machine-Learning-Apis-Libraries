# Comparing-Machine-Learning-Apis-Libraries
A comparison of exsisting Machine Learning libraries, apis and their best suited use case.

With the advent of machine learning developing in the public conciousness there seems to have been an explosion of services to compete internally within all of the big tech names. So that can leave developers like you and I wonder which service or library is the best for our applications?

This repository hopes to clear that up.

# BIG NAME API SERVICES
### Watson

### Microsoft Azure:

# Independant Code Libraries
For those that like the most flexibility, I think Python SkLearn might still be the most versatile.
